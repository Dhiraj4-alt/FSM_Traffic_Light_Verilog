# FSM_Traffic_Light_Verilog
Finite State Machine (FSM)-based traffic light control logic implementation using Verilog HDL. The system simulates traffic signal behavior at two-way intersection using a Moore FSM Model with concepts such as state transitions, clock-based sequencing, encoding logic to represent traffic light colors (Red,Yellow,Green).
